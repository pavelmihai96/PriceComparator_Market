# PriceComparator_Market
The goal of this project is to build the backend for a "Price Comparator - Market" application. A service that helps users compare prices of everyday grocery items across different supermarket chains (e.g., Lidl, Kaufland, Profi). The system should allow users to track price changes, find the best deals, and manage their shopping lists effectively.
